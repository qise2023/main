Task 1 (2.1) - quantum authentication/network testbed.  Paul is leading. Currently Paul has a postdoc and two students. Dave can also be involved. <br>
Task 2 (2.2) - quantum algorithm and speed up, Andrew is leading (with his doc student). Eric and Paul will also explore.<br>
Task 3 (2.3) - edu. Dave is leading. Eric/Dave to work on curriculum development and Dave on workforce development.<br>
